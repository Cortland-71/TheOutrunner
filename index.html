                    Synthwave (also called outrun, retrowave, or futuresynth) is a genre of electronic music influenced
                    by 1980s film soundtracks and video games.
                    The genre developed from various niche communities on the Internet during the mid 2000s, reaching
                    wider popularity in the early 2010s. In its music and cover artwork, synthwave engages in
                    retrofuturism, emulating 1980s science fiction, action, and horror media, sometimes compared to
                    cyberpunk. It expresses nostalgia for 1980s culture, attempting to capture the era's atmosphere
                    and celebrate it.

                        Synthwave was inspired by many 1980s films, video games, and cartoons, as well as composers such
                        as John Carpenter, Jean-Michel Jarre, Vangelis, and Tangerine Dream. However the genre itself
                        arose from electronic dance music genres including house, synth, and nu-disco.
                        The subgenre name "outrun" comes from the 1986 driving arcade game Out Run, which was known for
                        its
                        soundtrack that could be selected in-game. According to musician Perturbator (James Kent), the
                        style
                        is mainly instrumental, and often contains 1980s clichéd elements in the sound such as
                        electronic
                        drums, gated reverb, and analog synthesizer bass lines and leads - all to resemble tracks from
                        that
                        time period.

                    This aesthetic has been incorporated into retro themed movies and video games featuring
                    synthwave
                    artists. According to Bryan Young of Glitchslap, one of the most notable examples of this is
                    Power
                    Glove's soundtrack to the 2013 video game Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon. Another popular example of
                    the
                    genre crossing into other media is David Sandberg's short film Kung Fury.

                        There have been many mainstream uses of synthwave for the soundtracks for shows and movies.
                        The 2011 movie Drive featured a whole synthwave style soundtrack that goes along with the films
                        cinematography and style very well.
                        <br><br>The release of movies like Tron: Legacy in 2010 or Drive in 2011,
                        whose soundtrack featured several synthwave artists, pushed new fans and artists toward the
                        genre.

                    Following the various influxes of new artists into the genre, several of these artists
                    gravitated toward
                    specific aspects of synthwave carved out by the early artists, leading to a wide variation in
                    styles
                    between artists who are associated with the genre. Nerdglow's Christopher Higgins cited Electric
                    Youth
                    and Kavinsky as the two most popular artists in synthwave in 2014. Since 2013, synthwave has
                    reached a
                    broader audience from outside artists' fan bases and through popular media, thanks to games like
                    Far
                    Cry 3: Blood Dragon and Hotline Miami. Also, the third season of the Netflix series, Stranger
                    Things,
                    featured many Synthwave pieces that fit perfectly with the shows 1980's setting.

                        Vaporwave is an Internet-based microgenre that was built upon the experimental and ironic
                        tendencies of genres such as chillwave and hypnagogic pop. It draws primarily on musical and
                        cultural sources from the 1980s and early 1990s while also being associated with an ambiguous or
                        satirical take on consumer capitalism and technoculture. The name derives from "vaporware", a
                        term for commercial software that is announced but never released. Vaporwave is defined largely
                        by its surrounding subculture while its music is inextricable from its visual accountrements. It
                        extends to visual formats as much as it does music and embraces the Internet as a cultural, social, and aesthetic

                    medium. Additionally, it is sometimes suggested to be "first and
                    foremost a visual medium", as academic Laura Glitsos writes, "In this way, vaporwave defies
                    traditional music conventions that typically privilege the music over the visual form.

                    incorporates early Internet imagery, late 1990s web design, glitch art, and cyberpunk tropes, as

                    economic flourishing in the 1980s and the September 11 attacks or dot-com bubble burst of 2001 (some
                    albums, including Floral Shoppe, depict the intact Twin Towers on their covers)

                        Musically, vaporwave subverts dance music from the 1980s and 1990s. It consists of "brief,
                        cut-up sketches", cleanly produced, and composed almost entirely from samples, along with the
                        application of slowed-down chopped and screwed techniques, looping, and other effects. Critic
                        Adam Trainer writes of the style's predilection for "music made less for enjoyment than for the
                        regulation of mood", such as corporate stock music for infomercials and product demonstrations.
                        Musicologist Adam Harper described the typical vaporwave track as "a wholly synthesised or
                        heavily processed chunk of corporate mood music, bright and earnest or slow and sultry, often
                        beautiful, either looped out of sync and beyond the point of functionality".

                        The genre is cited for espousing an ambiguous or accelerationist relationship to consumer
                        capitalism. Dummy Mag's Adam Harper wrote in 2012 that "these musicians can be read as sarcastic
                        anti-capitalists revealing the lies and slippages of modern techno-culture and its
                        representations, or as its willing facilitators, shivering with delight upon each new wave of
                        delicious sound." He noted that the name itself was both a nod to vaporware and the idea of
                        libidinal energy being subjected to relentless sublimation under capitalism. Michelle Lhooq of
                        Vice argued that "parodying commercial taste isn't exactly the goal. Vaporwave doesn't just
                        recreate corporate lounge music–it plumps it up into something sexier and more synthetic.
