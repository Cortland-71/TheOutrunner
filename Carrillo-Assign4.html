                    <b>Synthwave</b> (also called outrun, retrowave, or futuresynth) is a genre of electronic music
                    influenced
                    by 1980s film soundtracks and video games.
                    The genre developed from various niche communities on the Internet during the mid 2000s, reaching
                    wider popularity in the early 2010s. In its music and cover artwork, synthwave engages in
                    retrofuturism, emulating 1980s science fiction, action, and horror media, sometimes compared to
                    cyberpunk. It expresses nostalgia for 1980s culture, attempting to capture the era's atmosphere
                    and celebrate it.

                    Synthwave was inspired by many 1980s films, video games, and cartoons, as well as composers such
                    as John Carpenter, Jean-Michel Jarre, Vangelis, and Tangerine Dream. However the genre itself
                    arose from electronic dance music genres including house, synth, and nu-disco.
                    The subgenre name "outrun" comes from the 1986 driving arcade game Out Run, which was known for its
                    soundtrack that could be selected in-game. According to musician Perturbator (James Kent), the style
                    is mainly instrumental, and often contains 1980s clichéd elements in the sound such as electronic
                    drums, gated reverb, and analog synthesizer bass lines and leads - all to resemble tracks from that
                    time period. This aesthetic has been incorporated into retro themed movies and video games featuring
                    synthwave artists. According to Bryan Young of Glitchslap, one of the most notable examples of this
                    is
                    Power Glove's soundtrack to the 2013 video game Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon. Another popular example of
                    the genre crossing into other media is David Sandberg's short film Kung Fury.

                    There have been many mainstream uses of synthwave for the soundtracks for shows and movies.
                    The 2011 movie Drive featured a whole synthwave style soundtrack that goes along with the films
                    cinematography and style very well. The release of movies like Tron: Legacy in 2010 or Drive in
                    2011,
                    whose soundtrack featured several synthwave artists, pushed new fans and artists toward the
                    genre. Following the various influxes of new artists into the genre, several of these artists
                    gravitated toward specific aspects of synthwave carved out by the early artists, leading to a wide
                    variation in
                    styles between artists who are associated with the genre. Nerdglow's Christopher Higgins cited
                    Electric
                    Youth and Kavinsky as the two most popular artists in synthwave in 2014. Since 2013, synthwave has
                    reached a broader audience from outside artists' fan bases and through popular media, thanks to
                    games like
                    Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon and Hotline Miami. Also, the third season of the Netflix series, Stranger
                    Things, featured many Synthwave pieces that fit perfectly with the shows 1980's setting.

                    <b>Vaporwave</b> is an Internet-based microgenre that was built upon the experimental and ironic
                    tendencies of genres such as chillwave and hypnagogic pop. It draws primarily on musical and
                    cultural sources from the 1980s and early 1990s while also being associated with an ambiguous or
                    satirical take on consumer capitalism and technoculture. The name derives from "vaporware", a
                    term for commercial software that is announced but never released. Vaporwave is defined largely
                    by its surrounding subculture while its music is inextricable from its visual accountrements. It
                    extends to visual formats as much as it does music and embraces the Internet as a cultural,
                    social, and aesthetic medium. Additionally, it is sometimes suggested to be "first and
                    foremost a visual medium", as academic Laura Glitsos writes, "In this way, vaporwave defies
                    traditional music conventions that typically privilege the music over the visual form.

                    The visual aesthetic (often stylized as <i>"A E S T H E T I C S"</i>, with fullwidth characters)
                    incorporates early Internet imagery, late 1990s web design, glitch art, and cyberpunk tropes, as
                    well as anime, Greco-Roman statues, and 3D-rendered objects. VHS degradation is another common
                    effect seen in vaporwave art. Generally, artists limit their source material between Japan's
                    economic flourishing in the 1980s and the September 11 attacks or dot-com bubble burst of 2001 (some
                    albums, including Floral Shoppe, depict the intact Twin Towers on their covers).

                    Musically, vaporwave subverts dance music from the 1980s and 1990s. It consists of "brief,
                    cut-up sketches", cleanly produced, and composed almost entirely from samples, along with the
                    application of slowed-down chopped and screwed techniques, looping, and other effects. Critic
                    Adam Trainer writes of the style's predilection for "music made less for enjoyment than for the
                    regulation of mood", such as corporate stock music for infomercials and product demonstrations.
                    Musicologist Adam Harper described the typical vaporwave track as "a wholly synthesised or
                    heavily processed chunk of corporate mood music, bright and earnest or slow and sultry, often
                    beautiful, either looped out of sync and beyond the point of functionality".

                    The genre is cited for espousing an ambiguous or accelerationist relationship to consumer
                    capitalism. Dummy Mag's Adam Harper wrote in 2012 that "these musicians can be read as sarcastic
                    anti-capitalists revealing the lies and slippages of modern techno-culture and its
                    representations, or as its willing facilitators, shivering with delight upon each new wave of
                    delicious sound." He noted that the name itself was both a nod to vaporware and the idea of
                    libidinal energy being subjected to relentless sublimation under capitalism. Michelle Lhooq of
                    Vice argued that "parodying commercial taste isn't exactly the goal. Vaporwave doesn't just
                    recreate corporate lounge music–it plumps it up into something sexier and more synthetic.

                <p>
                    Generally seen as Vaporwave's happy-go-lucky sibling, <b>Future Funk</b> takes the sampling aspect
                    of
                    Vaporwave, but rather than try to turn it into a decayed version of what it once was to mock the
                    hollowness of capitalism at the time, Future Funk will take samples from 1970's and 1980's disco
                    tracks and cut them in a way to make a completely new, groovy track for the people to enjoy.

                    The Future Funk sound tends to draw a lot of inspiration from French House and Synth Funk and
                    makes new, fun, poppy music (in a time when, frankly, we desperately need it). The aesthetics
                    from Future Funk are definitely Animecore to the max, taking lots of inspiration from anime from
                    the 70's, 80's, and 90's (Sailor Moon and Lum from Urusei Yatsura, in particular, are very
                    popular to use in Future Funk, making them unofficial mascots for the genre). As stated above,
                    Future Funk takes musical cues from Vaporwave, French House (which gives it some very subtle
                    connections to the poppier entries into the Synthwave genre), Nu-Disco, and Synth Funk to create
                    fun, happy tracks to dance to.

                    Taking samples of old funk tracks from the 70's and 80's (bonus points for using Japanese funk
                    music, which is very obscure compared to its American counterparts) and repurposing them in a
                    manner similar to Vaporwave (to the point where Future Funk will often just be lumped in with
                    the genre despite the very clear differences in musical philosophy between Future Funk and
                    Vaporwave. Some popular artists in the Future Funk genre include マクロスMACROSS 82-99, Topaz Gang,
                    Flamingosis, Yung Bae, Mike Tenay, Architecture in Tokyo, Yuni Wa, スーパーセックス永遠にSUPERSEX420,
                    Fibre, Night Temp, and 悲しい ANDROID - APARTMENT. Visually, as popularized by the YouTube channel
                    Artzie Music, Future Funk visual aesthetics are usually just a looped GIF of a classic anime set to
                    the track (popular animes to utilize are Sailor Moon and Urusei
                    Yatsura, although other classics will pop up like Dragon Ball, Lupin the 3rd, Mobile Suit Gundam,
                    and Macross) so there's definitely a HEAVY element of Animecore to the visual aesthetics of Future
                    Funk, but it's also not unusual to find aesthetic cues from Vaporwave and Synthwave, either.

                <p>
                    Probably one of the most abstract subgenres of vaporwave, Broken Transmission or Signalwave is
                    characterized by the splicing of random and often contrasting samples from retro television—breaking
                    each other’s ‘transmission’—to create the sound that comes from flipping through channels on a
                    television.

                        Another approach to Broken Transmission is Blizzard 96’s self-titled project released last year.
                        This album slows down and distorts recordings from the Weather Channel during a monumental
                        blizzard that affected the Northeast in January 1996. As explained in the artist’s bandcamp,
                        this album represents a special childhood memory that can be captured as nostalgia through the
                        distortions of vaporwave.

                        The hallmark album of this subgenre is Fuji Grid TV EX from 2011, a project by pioneering
                        producer Ramona Xavier under the pseudonym New Dreams Unlimited. Xavier leans into the
                        anti-consumerist philosophy through the album’s heavy use of jarring and haunting distortion of
                        ad tunes that are continuously spliced together. The final product emulates the feeling of an
                        uninterrupted bombardment of commercials.
